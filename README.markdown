vim-ryz
=======

My personal Vim/gVim configuration, flavored by pathogen and some plugins.
It should work out-of-box, platform independend. At least thats what I'm aiming for ;)

Plugins are included via git submodules.

Installation
------------

Install to `~/.vim/` or `$HOME/vimfiles` respectively, dependend on your OS.
Also, 'vimrc' should be renamed to '.vimrc' on linux or '_vimrc' on Windows.
